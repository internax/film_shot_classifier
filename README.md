This project focuses on the automatic classification of cinematic shot types (such as **close-up**, **medium**, and **wide** shots) from video or image data. The classification is based on detecting and analyzing visual features â€” primarily faces and objects â€” using classical computer vision techniques (e.g., **Haar cascades**) and handcrafted feature extraction.

The motivation for this tool is to support tasks such as:
- **Film style analysis**
- **Shot distribution statistics**
- **Automated metadata generation** for video datasets

The application processes input frame-by-frame, extracts spatial and geometric features, classifies the shot type, and optionally evaluates the performance against a labeled dataset.
