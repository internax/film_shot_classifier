# ðŸŽ¬ Film Shot Type Classification

This project focuses on the automatic classification of cinematic shot types (such as **close-up**, **medium**, and **wide** shots) from video or image data. The classification is based on detecting and analyzing visual features â€” primarily faces and objects â€” using classical computer vision techniques (e.g., **Haar cascades**) and handcrafted feature extraction.

The motivation for this tool is to support tasks such as:
- **Film style analysis**
- **Shot distribution statistics**
- **Automated metadata generation** for video datasets

The application processes input frame-by-frame, extracts spatial and geometric features, classifies the shot type, and optionally evaluates the performance against a labeled dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Tasks
- `main` â€“ Program entry point 
- `UserStructs` â€“ Definitions of shared data types and enums

### Miroslaw
- `FeatureDetector` â€“ Object detection using Haar cascades  
- `FeatureProcessorAndClassifier` â€“ Feature extraction and shot type classification logic  
-

### Marek 
- `FilmStatisticEval` â€“ Aggregates classification results across frames  
- `TestDatasetEval` â€“ Compares predictions with ground truth labels
- `FileLoader` â€“ Abstract interface for loading images or video  
- `ResultDisplayer` â€“ Displays or exports results

## Notes
- Do not make deep copies, since we are aiming to work with video
- Do not use static varibles inside classes
- Respect dataflow and do not edit it without telling others
