\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents extracted geometric and area-\/based properties from a video frame. 

\doxylink{struct_shot_features}{Shot\+Features} holds intermediate data used for shot type classification. It includes statistics like the number of detected objects, the total and largest object area, and the coordinates of their centers.

The {\ttfamily object\+\_\+centers} vector is ordered by object size, with the largest first. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
